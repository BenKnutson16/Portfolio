Project #5: Portfolio with SQLAlchemy

This is my fifth project for Treehouse Techdegree. I used flask and sqlalchemy to create a digital portfolio.
I learned a lot about how HTML, CSS, and python can work together to create a functional and stylish website.

In order to run this project locally:

1. Activate the virtual environment
2. Install the packages listed in requirements.txt
3. Type "python app.py" in the terminal
4. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser
